{ Let's start our journey through the magical world of Smyslov games by examining some of the games from his early years. Even though many associate Smyslov's name with solid, quiet and positional play and superb endgame technique, in his life - and especially in his youth - he has played his fair share of wild, sharp, attacking games.
The following game, played in Moscow, in 1940 is a perfect example. Let's start with the very first exercise. Can you find the move Smyslov played in the game - and the corresponding idea? }

The following game, played in Moscow, in 1940 is a perfect example. }

For example, he ventured it in his World Championship Matches against Mikhail Botvinnik, among other things. } 1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 d6 { This move leads to the so-called Steinitz variation of the Ruy Lopez - a line that was very popular back in the day due to its solidity. Black reinforces the e5 point and has various developing schemes to follow it up available. } 5. d4!? { But this move, involving a sharp pawn sacrifice, is definitely not the most common continuation nor the one you would expect from "harmonic and positional" Smyslov.
White strikes in the center immediately, but this essentially gambits a pawn. } 5... b5 6. Bb3 Nxd4 7. Nxd4 exd4 8. c3!? { Since White can't really regain the pawn on d4 at once due to the exposed bishop on b3, he has to gambit a pawn in some way. Playing c3, undermining the center and aiming for rapid development is one possible way of doing so. } (8. Qxd4? { Doesn't work due to the well-known
opening trap: } 8... c5 9. Qd5 { Seemingly saving the bishop due
to the double attack, but this is only an illusion. } { [%cal Rb3f7,Rd5a8] } 9... Be6 10. Qc6+ Bd7 11. Qd5 c4 $19 { And the bishop on b3 is finally lost! } { [%cal Rc4b3] }) (8. Bd5 Rb8 9.

principled way of playing. } 9. Qh5!? { With this move, White tries to create pressure against the f7 pawn while at the same time keeping the route Nc3-Nd5 open for the knight on b1.

easy for Black to develop the kingside. } { [%csl Rf6,Rf8,Rg7] } 11... Be6 12. O-O c6 { With this move, Black defends the d5 square and tries to stay solid, but this is somewhat passive as it allows White to bring in more pieces into the fray.
Furthermore, it will transpire that this pawn can become a target and allow some hidden tactical possibilities later in the game. } (12... g6 13. Qf3 { then this queen move,

{ Smyslov's career - just like the careers of so many other chess players of that era - was inevitably affected by World War II, during which all International Chess Competitions ceased (and during which the whole world was sent on turmoil, obviously).
In fact, many of Smyslov's chess-playing peers and even childhood friends, who weren't necessarily as strong as him, were called to the army and ended up losing their lives on the battlefront. Fortunately, Smyslov was not one of them as he got a job in aviation (I believe, but don't quote me on it) and spent the war years working in an office, away from the front.
On the other hand, even though there weren't any International tournaments at the time, the Soviet Chess Federation was keen on not letting their players get completely rusty and organized quite a few tournaments during the War Years.
It was during one of those war-tournaments - the Moscow Championship 1943 - when Smyslov managed to defeat the great Mikhail Botvinnik for the very first time.
Let's join the came on move 21. Even though he employed a very dubious variation of the Ruy Lopez, after an unforced error on Smyslov's part, Botvinnik took over the initiative. At this critical juncture, he has to decide on the course of action - and it is precisely here where Botvinnik went wrong. Can you do better than the Patriarch and suggest a convincing course of action? }

{ In the previous two encounters, we have seen how Smyslov had the ability to play very violent, tactical, Tal-like chess - especially in his youth (but not only in his youth). However, as a player, he is much more famous for his positional, logical and "simple" style with the help of which he sometimes outplayed his opponents imperceptibly and quietly.
A perfect example of "vintage" Smyslov style is the following game, played against the Ukrainian Master Iosif Rudakovsky in the 1945 USSR Championship. It is a very famous game that I use to this day to illustrate the power of occupying the d5 square in the Najdorf structure and it is a classic example of the "Good Knight vs The Bad Bishop" scenario.
The first critical position arose on move 13. Black just moved the bishop to e6. Why exactly is this not the best positional idea? } { [%csl Re6] }
13. f5 { A very strong continuation that is very typical for this Najdorf structure (with the Black pawns on d6 and e5). White grabs space on the kingside and removes the pawn from f4 where it can potentially be exchanged for the pawn on e5. When doing this maneuver, White does need to be careful not to allow the immediate counterstrike with d5, which is not the case here because this advance comes with the tempo on the bishop on e6. } { [%csl Gf5][%cal Rf5e6] } 13... Bc4?! { Continuing with the idea of exchanging the bishops, but it is actually wrong as it weakens Black's grip over the d5 square. It is much easier for Black's bishop to control the d5 square than for the bishop on e2, so this exchange is very much in White's favour. } { [%csl Rc4] } (13... Bd7 { Retreating the bishop to d7 was objectively better, but now the e4 pawn is not under the attack and White can once again play } 14. Bg5 Bc6 15.

Bxc4 Qxc4 15. Bg5 { A very strong move! White now exchanges the final defender of the d5 square and intends to plant their own knight there - and there is nothing Black can do against this plan, as Rudakovsky has just exchanged the last defender - the bishop on e6. } { [%cal Rg5e7] } 15... Rfe8 { It is probably better to put the rook on another file as on e8 it merely ends up in some tactical problems, but as it is, Black's position is strategically suspect. } 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 { Now we can see Black has no pieces that can prevent the knight from finding a happy home on d5 - and that
factor alone is already sufficient for the game to be strategically lost. } 17. Nd5 { Furthermore - due to the positioning of the rooks (a consequence of the move Re8) - White can jump to d5 immediately. } { [%csl Ra8,Gd5,Re8][%cal Gd5c7] } 1-0

{ So, we have just seen how White managed to plant the knight on d5, which almost immediately leads to a difficult position for Black. However, on the next move, Rudakovsky made Smyslov's job even easier. Can you do better and suggest the most resilient defensive move for Black in this position? }
17... Qxc2 { For better or for worse, Black should have probably captured the pawn on c2. At first glance, it seems as if it loses an exchange - but at least it disrupts the natural flow of the game - and forces White to give up the
wonderful knight on d5 (that is easily worth at least a rook). } (17...

slouch, but a very respectable master and the game was played at the strongest competition of that time - the USSR Championship - which just shows how much chess has evolved in the last 70 years on all fronts - especially in regard to the opening knowledge and in terms of defensive play. } { [%cal Gd5d8] } 1-0

{ Even though there weren't any major International chess tournaments during World War II, in the war-torn USSR more than a few tournaments were organized in the 1942-1945 period. Thus, Smyslov - as well as other Soviet players - did get their regular practice and continued developing.
It is, therefore, not surprising that, after the war, Smyslov already turned out to be one of the best chess players in the world. It already showed in the first International tournament held in Groningen in 1946 where Smyslov came in third behind Botvinnik and Euwe. Thus, it wasn't surprising that Smyslov was invited
to be one of the participants in the FIDE World Championship Tournament, held in the Hague and Moscow in 1948.
This tournament was supposed to resolve the interregnum state after Alekhine's death. part from Botvinnik and Smyslov, Euwe, Keres, and Reshevsky participated. It was precisely the American grandmaster that the Soviets feared the most as he was considered to be Botvinnik's most serious competitor.
Every encounter with Reshevsky, was, thus, of utmost importance - but in round 11 of the tournament Smyslov inflicted him a devastating blow. It is one of those brilliant strategic/positional masterpieces Smyslov was rather known for and is definitely one of his best games that fully deserves to be included on this list.
Let's join the game at the first critical moment - on the move 13. Reshevsky used the Steinitz Defence of Ruy Lopez in this game, but didn't handle the opening in a very critical manner (not surprising, given that Reshevsky was never a true opening specialist). Yet, in the diagram position, there is a lot of tension in the center and it is not so easy to figure out how best to handle it. How would you continue as White here? Can you find the move Smyslov played? }

White deals with the threat to the e4 pawn and claims that Black has no good way of recapturing on e5 for positional reasons. } 13... Bxe5 { It is hard to say which recapture is better.

{ Let's join the game slightly later - on move 25. After a few transformations, the position has become completely winning for White, as Black has a weak pawn on d6 and White also has the bishop pair. However, things are never very easy in chess - currently Black wants to play Nd7, remove the bishop from b6, then
slowly unravel with Rd8, Nc5 and so on.
Smyslov, however, found a wonderful way to transform the advantage and transition to a favourable endgame. Can you find the set of maneuvers he played at this very moment? }

{ After some further adventures, on move 41, the following rook endgame has been reached. Black has a passed pawn, but White has 4 vs 2 majority on the kingside. Furthermore, Black's rook is in front of the a-pawn, while White's rook on a7 is placed ideally behind the passed pawn. Due to all these factors,
White should be winning - but it is good to learn the winning technique in similar endgames.
Ideally, I would recommend you try and win this position against the computer. Alternatively, you can try to guess how Smyslov continued here - although in this type of position it is not so much about the moves as much as the concepts! }

{ As we have previously seen, already in 1948, Smyslov was considered to be one of the strongest players in the world and a legitimate contender for the World Chess Championship title. And even though things didn't go his way in the very next cycle (which was - somewhat surprisingly - won by David Bronstein) - starting from the 1953-1954 World Championship Cycle Smyslov would dominate the remainder of the 1950s and participate in no less than three World Championship Matches against Mikhail Botvinnik.
The crucial step toward his first World Chess Championship match against Botvinnik was the legendary Candidates Tournament 1953, played in Zürich. After 21 rounds, Smyslov was tied with Reshevsky at 12.5/21, while the legendary Estonian Paul Keres was just behind them with half a point less.
It goes without saying that the encounter between Keres and Smyslov in the 22nd round was of tremendous competitive importance. We are now going to examine this historic game.
The first critical position arose on move 16. Smyslov didn't play the opening perfectly and ended up in a
suspicious position. How should have Keres continued here? }

1. c4 { Keres was a very versatile player that could open with virtually any first move.

{ Thus, after winning the Zürich Candidates Tournament in 1953, Smyslov qualified for the match against Botvinnik that was held in 1954 in Moscow. This match turned out to be one of the most fighting and "bloodiest" in the entire history of chess. Out of 24 games, 14 had a decisive outcome and at some point there was a streak of 8- decisive games.
Smyslov himself started extremely poorly, losing 3 out of the first 4 games. However, after winning game 7 and then scoring a hat trick in games 9-11, he took the lead briefly before losing games 12 and 13 and finding himself trailing by a point again.
But then, in game 14, he managed to win again and level the scores again. This is probably his most impressive creative achievement from that first match and fully deserves to be mentioned here.
Let's start our explorations by examining the wild opening position that arose on move 14. From the modern viewpoint, this whole variation of the King's Indian is dubious, but it is not so easy to prove it. How would you continue as White?

{ As we have seen previously, in the 1954 match, Smyslov failed to win the title by the narrowest of margins. And even though by drawing the match he proved he is Botvinnik's equal, he had to go through the grueling process of qualification once again and repeat the feat of winning the Candidates tournament - which he duly managed to do so by winning the 1956 Amsterdam Candidates tournament - 1.5 point ahead of Keres (who once again came second).
Thus, in 1957, the 2nd Botvinnik - Smyslov match was held in Moscow. This time, Smyslov was in control virtually from the start of the match. After winning the 1st game, he did lose games 4 and 5 only to immediately level the score in game 6 and then seize a two-point lead by winning games 8 and 12.
Nevertheless, Botvinnik wasn't to go away so easily as he managed to reduce the lead by winning the 13th game. Thus, after 3 subsequent draws, by game 17 the tension had reached its peak. It is at this particular moment that Smyslov played the following marvelous game that virtually clinched the match in his favour. In contrast to the previous game, which was a tactical masterpiece, this game was a pure positional/strategic battle. On move 19, we have a position with symmetricla pawn structure, but where Black arguably has a bit more potential to improve the position. Can you find the plan/concept Smyslov utilized to improve his position in this exact moment? }

{ In the game, Botvinnik decided to stay passive, but this allowed Smyslov to obtain a decisive advantage with the help of a very thematic move. Which one? }
45... g5 { Now this move is very powerful as Black removes one obstacle on the kingside and White also needs to lose a tempo to get the knight back to c2 and initiate the whole idea with a4-b4 and so on - which means that White is now objectively completely lost - in many pawn endgames, the weakness of the e3 pawn and the potential advance of the f-pawn will be decisive.
I think we could stop for the purposes of this exercise as the path toward victory is still lengthy. Still, it is very instructive to observe how Smyslov goes about outmaneuvering Botivnnik and winning this position, so I would definitely urge the dear student to check the full game - or even try to win this position against the computer. } { [%csl Gg5] } 0-1

{ As we have seen previously, in the 1954 match, Smyslov failed to win the title by the narrowest of margins. And even though by drawing the match he proved he is Botvinnik's equal, he had to go through the grueling process of qualification once again and repeat the feat of winning the Candidates tournament - which he duly managed to do so by winning the 1956 Amsterdam Candidates tournament - 1.5 point ahead of Keres (who once again came second).
Thus, in 1957, the 2nd Botvinnik - Smyslov match was held in Moscow. This time, Smyslov was in control virtually from the start of the match. After winning the 1st game, he did lose games 4 and 5 only to immediately level the score in game 6 and then seize a two-point lead by winning games 8 and 12.
Nevertheless, Botvinnik wasn't to go away so easily as he managed to reduce the lead by winning the 13th game. Thus, after 3 subsequent draws, by game 17 the tension had reached its peak. It is at this particular moment that Smyslov played the following marvelous game that virtually clinched the match in his favour. In contrast to the previous game, which was a tactical masterpiece, this game was a pure positional/strategic battle. }

game, we see a relatively quiet variation of the Fianchetto Grünfeld defence. } 8... b6 { With this move Black intends to develop the bishop to b7, but it is a little bit passive, although it is still played at the grandmaster level to this day. } { [%cal Gc8b7] } 9. Bg5 { I am not 100% sure I understand this move. The idea is potentially to eliminate the knight on f6 that can sometimes jump to e4, but I am not sure if that is the most dangerous idea of all time. Furthermore, the bishop is exposed to Ne4 jumps on this particular square. } (9. O-O { Is seen more often nowadays, when after } 9... Bb7 10. Qa4 { or } (10. Bf4 { Are both viable options. })) 9... Bb7 { Continuing with the development of thee bishop and preparing to jump with the knight to e4. } { [%csl Ge4][%cal Gf6e4] } 10. Bxf6 { The point of White's play. I guess the argument is that the knight on f6 is very valuable here and that Black's dark-squared bishop doesn't have that much scope, but still - White does give up the bishop pair voluntarily. } 10... Bxf6 11. O-O { I feel that after this move White doesn't have any advantage
whatsoever. } (11. f4 Bg7 12. h4 { This aggressive kingside expansion was seen in a game between my two compatriots - Zdenko Kožul and Ivan Šarić - and it seems it is a more principled and dangerous way of posing some problems compared

That game continued } 12... e6 13. h5 Nd7 14. hxg6 hxg6 15. e3 { When White had a small, but stable advantage, even though he ultimately ended up losing the game. }) 11... e6 12. f4 { A standard plan of reinforcing the e5 knight and creating a dark-square bind in these positions.

The knight is eyeing the potentially weakened c4 square. } { [%csl Gc4][%cal Ga5c4] } 17. h4 { Also very typical move, expanding on the kingside and preparing Bh3, trying to pressure the e6 pawn. } { [%cal Gh4h5,Gg2h3] } 17... Nc4 18. Bh3 { [%cal Rh3e6] } 18... Nd6 { Now the knight reroutes and also eyes the weak e4 square. Black shouldn't be worse here as both sides have some weaknesses and weak squares, although a complex strategic battle is in front of us. } { [%csl Ge4][%cal Gd6e4] } 19. Kh2 a5 20. Rfe1 b5 { Very good play. White's play in the center and on the kingside is somewhat stuck, while Black improves the position on the queenside. } 21. Nd1 b4 22. Nf2 Ba6 { The passive bishop is now activated and space advantage has been secured on the left hand side of the board. It is very instructive to observe how Smyslov quietly outplays his formidable opponent. } { [%csl Ga5,Gb4][%cal Ra6f1] } 23. Qd1 Rfc8 { The next step is the occupation of the open file. } 24. Rxc8+ { This is a bit too cooperative. As usual, exchanging on our opponent's ground helps them more than it helps us to relieve the tension. } (24. Rc5 { Hoping to double on the c-file in the future was interesting. }) (24. e4 { Trying to imbalance play by breaking through in the center was also a bit more combative than the text move. }) 24... Rxc8 25. Bf1 { Seeking further exchanges, but it transpires that this one is also to Black's benefit as now the light-squares are weakened. } { [%csl Gb5,Gc4,Ge4] } 25... Bxf1 26.

Qb5 { Trying to maintain the tension by keeping the queens on the board and trying to exploit some light-squares with, say, Nf5 next, came into consideration too. }) (26... h5 { Securing some more light-squares, was also interesting. } { [%csl Gf5,Gg4] }) 27. Nd3 Qc2+ { This looks tempting, but the queen exchange actually relinquishes a significant part of Black's advantage. } (27... h5 { Once again, maintaining the tension with some sort of semi-waiting move was worth considering. }) 28. Qxc2 Rxc2+ 29. Rf2 { This is the problem for Black. White manages to deal with the infiltration of the rook to c2 and now Black almost has either exchange or retreat, meaning that a large part of the advantage is now gone. } { [%csl Gf2][%cal Gd3f2] } 29... Rxf2+ 30. Nxf2 Nc4 31. Nd1 { Now all weaknesses are covered and without the heavy pieces on the board, it is hard to make progress for Black. Still, the game is far from over and now we enter a completely new stage of the game. } { [%csl Gb2][%cal Gd1e3,Gd1b2] } 31... Kf7 32. b3? { But this is a mistake. It is natural to want to kick the knight from the c4 square, but in the process, White is weakening the c3 square. } { [%csl Rc3][%cal Rb3c4] } (32. Kg2 h5 33. Kf2 { And it is hard for White to make further progress. }) 32... Nd6 33. Kg2 h5 { Clamping down on the light-squares! Black probably has to play this move sooner or later. } { [%csl Gg4] } 34. Kh3 { White tries to play g4 to eliminate some pawns, in return. } 34... Ne4 35. g4 hxg4+? { But this exchange also turns out to be a mistake as it changes the character of the structure on the kingside. Smyslov probably thought White's h4 pawn would be a weakness in the long-run, but it transpires that this is not necessarily true. } (35... Bf8 { It was better to simply continue waiting and improving the position as it is not entirely clear what White will do with the g-pawn. Say if } 36. g5 (36. gxh5 gxh5 { Also gives the Black king g6-f5 route. } { [%cal Gf7g6,Gg6f5,Gf5e4,Gf5g4] }) (36. Ne1 Bd6 37. Nd3 Bc7 { Puts White in some sort of zugzwang
as it gets more and more difficult to move the pieces, say } 38. Ne1 e5 { With a decisive opening of the position. }) 36... Bd6 37. gxf6 Kxf6 { The king can now infiltrate with f5 and e4/g4 in the future. } { [%cal Gf6f5,Gf5e4,Gf5g4] }) 36. Kxg4 f5+ { I guess this was the point of Smyslov's idea. Now the d8-h4 diagonal is open and Black can potentially try to attack the h4 pawn (which is what happens in the game). But it transpires that this is less strong than what was considered in the previous note. } (36... Bf8 37. Ne1 Bd6 38. Nd3 Bc7 { White can simply move the king and not the knight on d3 } 39. Kf3 { And it is hard for Black to make progress here. }) 37. Kh3 Bf6 38. Ne1 Kg7 39. Nd3 { Now once again, White's pieces are doing a good job of defending everything and it is hard to make progress. That is why Smyslov decides to sharply alter the character of the play and go for the transformation of the position. } { [%csl Gd3] } 39... Nc3!? { Sharply changing the character of play at the verge of the first time control (which usually happened on move 40). Smyslov invites the exchange of the knight and transformation into a bishop vs. knight endgame and seemingly there is no way for Botvinnik to refuse it! } (39... Be7 40. N1b2 { This is the computer solution. White gives up the c3 square but creates counterplay in an unexpected fashion, e.g. } (40. N3f2 { Is a more human way. After } 40... Nc3 41. a4 { White manages to remove the weakness on a2 and it is hard for Black to make progress. }) 40... Nc3 41. Nc5 Nxa2 42. Nb7 { And White has solved all the problems. }) 40. Nxc3 bxc3 { So, let us stop for the moment and ask ourselves - why exactly should Black pretend to be better in this endgame? Well, the pawn on c3 is a temporary distraction for our opponent and needs to be dealt with. The only way in which White can do so is by going with the king all the way to d3 and then capturing it. This, in turn, should allow Black to capture the h4 pawn (which is something he can do anyway, actually) and run with the king to f2, threatening to capture on e3. Furthermore, Black can also push g5 and then f4 at the appropriate moment. Thus, White has to defend accurately as Black has a clear plan of going forward. } { [%csl Rc3] } 41. Ne1 { Missing the immediate opportunity to resolve all problems! } (41. b4 { This should lead to a draw, although the lines are far from easy. } 41... a4 { The more complex try leading to a very complicated endgame. } (41... axb4 42. Nxb4 { White will very likely collect the c3 pawn at the right moment and the passed a-pawn will be a big enough nuisance to secure equality! }) 42. b5 { Is also sufficient as Black has to deal with the b-pawn. Play might continue } 42... Bd8 43. Kg3 Kh6 44. Kf2 Kh5 45. Ke2 { And now suddenly Black has to be careful with } 45... Ba5 (45... Kxh4 46. Nc5 { Is actually lost for Black as now } 46... Kg3 47.

on e6. }) 46. Kd1 Kxh4 47. Kc2 (47. Nc5 Kg3 48. Nxa4 Kf3 { Is different compared
to the previous variation as now c3 pawn has survived. } 49. Nc5 Kxe3 50. Nxe6 Kd3 51. Nc5+ Ke3 52. Ne6) 47... Kg3 { Although this endgame is still very
tricky and complicated. White now has to be precise with } 48. Nc5 Kf3 { The Black king is just in time. } 49. Kd3 c2 50. Kxc2 Kxe3 { And this whole mess should end in a draw after } 51. Nxe6 Ke4 52. Kb2 Kd3 53. Ka3 Kc3 54. Kxa4 { White does get connected passed pawns, but Black's king is far more active and restricting the enemy king (it doesn't allow it to go to b4 and then push the a-pawn) } 54... Bb6 55. Ka3 Ba7 56. Ka4 Bb6 { And neither side can make any progress here and the game should end in a draw. A fascinating variation that
demonstrates the full complexity of this endgame. }) 41... Kh6 42. Nc2 { Maneuvering the knight to c2 is very sensible, though, as now the pawn is blockaded and the d3 square vacated for the king. } { [%csl Gc2,Rc3,Gd3] } 42... Be7 { Now Black does prevent the b-pawn from advancing before assaulting the h4 pawn. } 43. Kg3 { Not yet losing, but it does demonstrate Botvinnik was not aware of the key idea in this position (which will end up costing him later). He could have advanced the a-pawn here at once. } (43. a4 { This would lead to a variation very similar to the one we will examine in notes to White's 45th move. }) 43... Kh5 { Black, of course, collects the h-pawn and tries to infiltrate with the
king. } 44. Kf3 (44. a4 { Was once again a bit more precise as it would have
forced Black to capture on h4 with the bishop. After } 44... Bxh4+ 45.

Botvinnik decides to stay passive and keep waiting, but it transpires that this is the wrong strategy as Black is now able to outmaneuver him, put him into zugzwang and infiltrate his king into the position. } (45. a4 { At this particular moment, it was absolutely necessary to advance the a-pawn. As mentioned earlier, it would have allowed White to have a nice defensive resource at the exact moment as the a-pawn is now closer to queening than it is in the game.

Nb4 Ke1 { And here Botvinnik finally resigned as the king will penetrate either to e2 or to the queenside and White will end up in a similar zugzwang as in the variation analyzed on move 66. A tremendous game and absolutely mesmerizing endgame play by Smyslov - at such an important and crucial moment of the match.
-After this game, Smyslov also won the 20th game and clinched the match after 22 games with a score 12.5-9.5, becoming, thus, the 7th World Champion. Alas, his reign would last only for one year as he would lose the title the very next year in the 1958 rematch, although his career would continue for a loong loong time after that. } 0-1

{ Thus, after losing the World Championship title in 1958 to Botvinnik, Smyslov didn't get another opportunity to fight for the World Chess Championship title until his shocking swansong in the 1983 cycle when he reached the final of the Candidates cycle before losing to the future World Champion, Garry Kasparov.
As this feat suggests, despite being the World Champion only for a single year, Smyslov continued playing at a high level and very successfully throughout his life. Due to his very logical and harmonic style and arguably his deep love for the game, he wasn't as affected by the age factor (or by health issues, like, for example, Tal) like some other players and continued to play tournaments all the way until the end of 1990s.
Of course, it is very hard to make a selection of the best games played over a 30+ year-long period, but I feel like any collection of Smyslov's best games should include the following fascinating game, played at the 6th Soviet Team Cup held in Riga in 1968.
Let's start our journey through it by examining the position that arose on move 22. Smyslov has managed to strategically outplay his opponent and now - a way to increase the advantage is required. How would you continue in this exact position? }

{ Thus, after losing the World Championship title in 1958 to Botvinnik, Smyslov didn't get another opportunity to fight for the World Chess Championship title until his shocking swansong in the 1983 cycle when he reached the final of the Candidates cycle before losing to the future World Champion, Garry Kasparov.
As this feat suggests, despite being the World Champion only for a single year, Smyslov continued playing at a high level and very successfully throughout his life. Due to his very logical and harmonic style and arguably his deep love for the game, he wasn't as affected by the age factor (or by health issues, like, for example, Tal) like some other players and continued to play tournaments all the way until the end of 1990s.
Of course, it is very hard to make a selection of the best games played over a 30+ year-long period, but I feel like any collection of Smyslov's best games should include the following fascinating game, played at the 6th Soviet Team Cup held in Riga in 1968. }
1. c4 { Not a surprising opening move by Smyslov. Especially in his later years, he switched from 1.e4 to slower, closed systems with increasing frequency. } 1... e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Rb1 { Preparing the push of the b-pawn is a standard plan in a number of positions where the pawn on c4 is meeting the pawn on e5. } 5... d6 6. b4 a6 { I am not sure if this move is required as it helps White to open up things on the queenside with b5, although it was played by some strong players so what do I even know. } 7. e3 f5 { I am also not too sure about this aggressive setup with f5 in these positions - especially with White having played e3 instead of d3, but once again, since I don't play these positions with either colour my insight should be taken with a huge grain of salt.
Nevertheless, this is a very fresh position with only a handful of games in the database. } 8. Nge2 Nf6 9. d3 O-O 10. O-O Bd7 11. a4 { White is very clearly preparing to go b5. } { [%cal Gb4b5] } 11... Rb8 { But this move doesn't make sense to me at all. If you played a6 earlier, weren't you hoping to open up the a-file for the rook once b5 happens? Why defend the pawn modestly with the rook then and deviate from that plan? } (11... Qe7 { A normal developing move seemed quite sensible. After } 12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 Nd8 { Black defends b7 and has the a-file open, which is certainly better than what happened in the game. }) 12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 Ne7 14. Ba3 { An active place for the bishop in these positions, as it is fairly active on this diagonal and eyeing the c5 square, preparing for the potential c5 push. There is also the idea of playing b6 next. } { [%cal Ra3f8,Gb5b6] } 14... Be6 15. Qb3 { I am not 100% sure about this move as now c5 is not possible, although the computer doesn't complain. } (15. c5 { Would be my expectation, although after } 15... d5 16. c6 { The situation is not completely clear. }) (15. Qc2 { I would also expect moving the queen to a square where there is no pin would be more sensible but, then again - what do I know. The engine thinks all these moves are roughly equivalent. }) 15... b6?! { But this is apparently wrong. Black decides to prevent c5 once at for all, but he is playing on the side of the board where their opponent is attacking. } (15... Qd7 { A semi-waiting move like this one was quite reasonable. Then after, say } 16. f4 Bf7 17. b6 c6 { The situation is
complicated, but Black is by no means THAT much worse. }) (15... Bf7 { It was also possible to play this prophylactic move, intending now to meet } 16. f4 { With } 16... exf4 17. Nxf4 { When the bishop is not under the attack. }) 16. d4 { Quite a good move, trying to react in the center. White also tries to exploit the newly weakened c6 square? How exactly. Watch and see! } 16... e4 { Black can't afford the center to open given that all White pieces are very actively placed. } 17. d5 { A very nice positional move, opening up the d4 square for the knight from where it can go to e6 and c6. It is true that this move weakens the e5 and c5 squares, but we have to lose some to gain some. Also, with this move we pretty much give up on the c5 idea, but we are ready to reroute our bishop to b2. } { [%csl Gc6,Gd4,Re6][%cal Rd5e6,Ge2d4,Gd4c6,Ga3b2] } 17... Bf7 18. Nd4 Qd7 (18... Nd7 { It was probably better to try and place the knight to c5 or e5 first, but as it is White keeps the edge and can even consider undermining the structure with } { [%cal Gd7c5,Gd7e5] } 19. f3 (19. Ra1 { Also comes into the
consideration. })) 19. Bb2 { The bishop retreats to the long diagonal. } { [%cal Rb2g7] } 19... g5 { Trying to initiate some kingside play and gain some space on that side of the board, but Black's pieces are not really ready for the kingside initiative. } 20. Nce2 { White slowly improves the pieces. Note how Smyslov doesn't hurry to jump with the d4 knight to either e6 or c6. } (20. Nc6 { Is somewhat of an empty shot as the knight only looks nice here, e.g. after } 20... Rbe8 { It is somewhat out of the game. }) (20. Ne6 { This simply loses a pawn } 20... Bxe6 21. dxe6 Qxe6) 20... Kh8 { Somewhat aimless move. It turns out the king might be in danger on this square in the future. } (20... Bh5 { was probably better, trying to activate some pieces and potentially exchange this slumbering bishop for the knight on e2. }) 21. Ra1 Ng6 22. f4 { A very powerful move, opening up the kingside to White's advantage and at the same time preventing Balck from ever playing f4! White's pieces are all perfectly placed so it is very natural that a pawn move is the best. } 22... exf3 { Now, it is true that White has weakened the e3 square and provided the e4 and g4 squares into Black's hands, but in this position where both sides have some weak squares, Black's weaknesses are more pronounced simply because White has better-placed pieces. } { [%csl Re3,Ge4,Gg4] } 23. Rxf3?! { This is, actually, not the most precise continuation. } (23. Nxf3 { Taking with the knight, opening up the bishop and threatening the g5 pawn was actually better. After, say } { [%csl Rg5][%cal Rf3g5,Rb2h8] } 23... h6 (23... Ne4 24. Bxg7+ Kxg7 25. Nfd4 { Is also very strong as Black's light-square weaknesses are very pronounced, e.g. } { [%cal Rd4f5] } 25... Bg8 26. g4!) 24. Nfd4 { The knight can simply go back, attack the f5 pawn at the moment when the bishop is keeping the e4 square under control. } { [%cal Rd4f5,Rg2e4] }) 23... Ne7? { But this passive defence of the f5 pawn is, well, simply too passive. } (23... Ne4 { The active jump with the knight was to be prefered, although it does look as if Black is losing a pawn. However after either } 24. Nxf5 (24. Rxf5 Nc5 { Black suddenly has some counterplay as the position is quite complicated. White should come out on top in both lines, but it is much more combative and murky than the game continuation. }) 24... Ne5) 24. Nc6 { Finally jumping to a weak square and hoping to eliminate the important defender of the f5 pawn. The other knight can always come to d4 and reinfroce the attack. } { [%csl Gc6][%cal Ge2d4] } (24. Raf1 { Increasing the pressure on the f5 pawn, was also quite good. }) 24... Rbe8 (24... Nxc6 { Taking the knight here is not too good as after } 25. bxc6 Qe7 26. Nd4 { Black is in deep trouble. } { [%cal Gd4e6,Rd4f5] }) 25. Ned4 { Now the other knight joins the fray and the threat to the f5 pawn is very real. } { [%csl Gc6,Gd4] } 25... Nfxd5 { This is absolute desperation, but probably the best practical attempt to confuse matters. } 26. cxd5? { But this recapture is probably a bit unecessary as it provides Black with reasonable counterplay all of a sudden. } (26. Raf1 { White could have simply ignored the knight on d5 and continued with the siege of the f5 pawn. The knight would still be hanging in that case and Black would have been left with less counterplay with best play, although the position still remains complicated, of course. }) 26... Bxd5 27. Nxf5!? { A very creative, Tal-like move, involving the sacrifice of the full queen, that is objectively fully correct - but probably not the most practical. The idea is to uncover the attack on the g7 bishop and create play against the weakened king. } (27. Qc2 { The prosaic retreat of the queen was quite sufficient though, although after } 27... Bxf3 28. Bxf3 { The technical task of converting the advantage is anything buy very easy. }) 27... Rxf5 { The only sensible move in this crazy position. } (27... Bxb3 { Would be losing on the
spot after } 28. Bxg7+ Kg8 29. Ncxe7+ Rxe7 30. Bxf8 Kxf8 { When there are several good moves, but probably the strongest is } 31. Rf2 { With the deadly idea of Bc6, trying to force the queen on a square where the discovered check will be deadly and also preparing Ra8 with a greater effect. } { [%cal Gg2c6] }) (27... Nxf5 { Loses at once to } 28. Qxd5) 28. Bxg7+ Kg8 29. Rxf5!! { This is the point of White's combination! Smyslov sacrifices a full queen, but is ready to capture on g5 next and execute a devastating winning attack. } { [%csl Rg5][%cal Rf5g5,Rg2d5,Rb3d5] } 29... Bxb3 { The only move! } (29... Qxf5 { Is losing due
to } 30. Nxe7+ Rxe7 31. Bxd5+) 30. Rxg5 { White has a bishop and the rook for the queen. But more importantly - the king on g8 is completely exposed and various threats are in the air. } 30... Ng6 { Trying to deal with the discovered attack along the g-file. } 31. Bh6? { But this is apparently a mistake which lets Black off the hook. } (31. Bd4 { Retreating the bishop to d4 was apparently better as it protects the e3 pawn and the bishop is more stable here. Despite being behind in material (the rook and bishop are worth less than the queen),
White is better because all the pieces have nice squares and are active and the king is very weak. Although winning this game is not an easy task. }) 31... Qe6 { The queen is quite active here and is ready to take on e3 with check. } 32. h4 { Creating a square on h2 for the king but allowing the pawn on e3 to fall with a check. } { [%cal Gg1h2] } (32. Re1 { Defending the e3 pawn is objectively better, but then Black can obtain some counterplay after, say } 32... Qc4 33. h4 Qc3 { When the position is very unclear. }) 32... Qxe3+ 33. Kh2 { Now White does have ideas of h5 and Rxg6 and Black's position is a bit difficult to handle in practical play, but considering how good White's position was before, I am sure Smyslov wasn't too happy at this particular point. } 33... Qc3 { A good move, moving the queen with a gain of tempo. } { [%cal Rc3a1] } 34. Rf1 { Bringing all the pieces to the kingside! } 34... Bc4?! { The first step in the wrong direction. Black is attacking the b5 pawn, but it transpires this pawn will be forever immune to capture and this allows the move h5 with tempo, basically. } (34... Kh8 { It was better to tuck the king away from the pin first before anything else, as now } 35. h5 Re2 { Provides Black with some serious counterplay. }) (34... Bf7 { Covering the f8 square and intending the same } 35. h5 Re2 { Idea was also better than what happened in the game. }) 35. Rf2 { Covering the 2nd rank agains the afore-mentioned Re2 idea. The position is still very complicated and Black has to play precisely in order to survive. } { [%cal Gf2a2] } 35... Qe1 { Attacking the rook and forcing it away from f2 once again. } { [%csl Rf2][%cal Re1f2] } 36. Rgf5 { Now White is threatening h5 and also has some Bd2-Bc3 ideas and Black has to be very precise in dealing with the both of them! This is the culminating point of this entire encounter! } 36... Bxb5?? { At the most inappropriate moment, Liberzon decides to capture the pawn on b5. The problem is that now the bishop on b5 is exposed which gives White time for the deadly Bd2-Bc3 idea. } (36... Be6 { It was not very easy to find the only defence here though. Black had to attack the rook on f5 and force it to f6 before moving the king to the corner. This was the only way to deal against both h5 and Bd2 threats. } 37. Rf6 { Now the long diagonal is blocked so Black can sidestep the h5 threat. } 37... Kh8 { This move prepares the defensive Bg8 resource which means that h5 loses its power. } { [%cal Ge6g8] } 38. h5 { White should play something else and maintain the balance, but in order to illustrate the point, let's see what happens after the advance of the h-pawn: } (38.

bruptly. }) 38... Ne5 39. Rf8+ Rxf8 40. Rxf8+ Bg8 { And it is suddenly Black who wins, not White. }) (36... Kh8 { This move doesn't work at once as after } 37. Bd2 Qa1 38.

{ As mentioned earlier, despite being an ex-world champion already in 1958, Smyslov continued to compete at the high level for decades. Arguably the greatest achievement from his later years happened in the 1982-1985 cycle.
First, Smyslov qualified for the Candidates' matches by winning the 2nd place at the strong Interzonal in Las Palmas (at the time, 3 Interzonals were held and two players from each Interzonal were seeded in the Candidates' matches, together with the finalists from the previous cycle).
Then, in the quarterfinal Candidates match, luck shined on him as he managed to eliminate Robert Hübner (the regular match ended up 5-5, four tiebreak games also didn't produce a winner which was, in the end, decided by a spin of the roulette wheel!!).
Then, in the semi-final Candidate match, Smyslov faced the strong Hungarian grandmaster Zoltan Ribli. After the wins were exchanged in the first two games and two subsequent games, the score in the match was tied. Then, the fifth game happened where Smyslov produced the following
masterpiece.
We join the action on move 16. Up to this moment, Ribli has been outplaying Smyslov quite
convincingly in the position with an isolated queen pawn and obtained a very good, almost winning position. However, at this crtiical moment, he underestimated the danger and made a big mistake. Can you improve on his play and find a reasonable move for Black in this position? }

big theoretical line these days. }) 6... Nc6 7. Bd3 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. a3 cxd4 10. exd4 { So, by transposition we have reached a standard position where White is the one with the isolated pawn on d4.
