determination of the central pawn structure gives his opponent greater
opportunities for seizing the initiative. But at that time the two players
were proceeding through virgin territory." - Kasparov } 9... b6 10. O-O Ba6 { White's
light squared bishop is a good piece, but it is doubtful whether Black should
exchange these pieces - his own bishop has a defensive function on b7 } (10... Nc6 { To illustrate the previous point, let us take a look at the potential
variation where Black develops his bishop on e6 instead } 11. Bb2 Na5 12. Ng3 Be6 13. f3 Rc8 14. e4 dxe4 15. fxe4 Ng4 16. Qe1 Bc4! { [pgndiagram] And
Black's control of the light squares shouldn't be underestimated. This is of
course just an illustrative variation. }) 11. Bxa6 { Another dilemma - should
White exchange here or not? } (11. f3 Bxd3 12. Qxd3 { His queen is on d3 and the knight still has to be developed. Still, the
position of the knight on a6 or c7 is not inspiring all the same }) 11... Nxa6 12. Bb2?! { Not the most precise move in the position. White overprotects d4
square and plans f3-e4 advance, but it is too early to determine the position
of this bishop } (12. Qd3 { Is more precise } 12... Qc8 13. f3 Re8 14. Ng3 Qb7 15. Re1 { [pgndiagram] And the bishop might become useful on the c1-g5 diagonal as well. }) 12... Qd7! { A good move, preparing Qa4 in the future with the blockade of

from ideal for Black }) 14. Qd3 c4!? { [pgndiagram] Kasparov and Botvinnik are
both critical of this move, but the computer makes this move instantly. } 15. Qc2 Nb8?! { Perhaps only this move is the start of the wrong plan - Black
invests four moves to place a knight on b3 and win the a4 pawn. White can use
this time constructively and carry out his central pawn advance } (15... Rad8 { Is perhaps to be prefered. After } 16. Ng3 (16. Rae1 Nc7 17. Ng3 Ne4 { Once

unsuccessful joke, the second gives rise to a genuine drama. The kamikaze
bishop forced the black queen to abandon its king to its fate and open the way
for the lucky e-pawn. " - Kasparov } 30... Qxa3 31. Nh5+ gxh5 32. Qg5+ Kf8 33. Qxf6+ Kg8 { [pgndiagram] Now only precision is required from White. Note how helpless

Tarrasch defence has been regarded as an inferior defence for a long time, but
it has been revived in the 21st century. But old masters didn't care all that
much about the opening verdicts back then - Botvinnik was the very first
player who started studying opening scientifically. } 6. e3 (6. e4 { Is the most
principled reply, which was tested extensively in the Alekhine-Euwe return
match }) 6... Nc6 7. Bc4!? { "A specifically prepared novelty." - Kasparov } 7... cxd4 8. exd4 { [pgndiagram] Once again, Botvinnik's favourite position with the
isolated pawn. } 8... Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. Re1 b6? { This seemingly natural move
turns out to be a serious mistake. Black weakens his knight on c6 and White
immediately exploits it. } (10... Nf6 { Removing the knight from exchange is
possible }) (10... Bf6 { Is also a move }) (10... a6 { Is also probably better
than what Black did in the game }) 11. Nxd5! { [pgndiagram] Typical Botvinnik
- when an opportunity for concrete play appears, he exploits it. } (11. Bb5 { Is
simply inferior } 11... Bb7 12. Qa4 Rc8 { And Black doesn't have any problems }) 11... exd5 { Now Black has an isolani of his own and white is able to generate
immediate play against Black's queenside } 12. Bb5 Bd7?! { From frying pan to
fire. } (12... Bb7 { Was neverthelesss better and more principled } 13. Qa4 { Kasparov suggests only this move, but I am not convinced it is the best } (13. Bf4!? { Was probably even better } 13... a6 14. Bd3 { And Black has serious problems.

is very instructive here: "The c-file is more important than the e-file, since
in the future the e7-square can be defended by the king, whereas the c7-square
remains vulnerable." } 19... Re7 (19... Nd7 20. Qc6 Qxc6 21. Rxc6 b5 { Also leads to a
very difficult endgame }) 20. Rxe7 Qxe7 21. Qc7 Qxc7 22. Rxc7 { [pgndiagram] One
of those endgames where White doesn't have a material advantage, but the
difference in placement of the pieces is more than enough to play for a win } 22... f6! { Alekhine defends tenaciously. This move prepares Rf7 and the eviction of
White's rook from the 7th rank. This move also prevents the knight jump to e5 } (22... g6 23. Ne5) 23. Kf1 (23. Rb7 Rc8 24. Kf1 b5 { [pgndiagram] And suddenly Black is out of danger }) 23... Rf7 24. Rc8+ Rf8 25. Rc3 g5 { Gaining some space on the kingside and removing the pawns

brilliant reply by White } (26... Kg7 { Loses almost immediately } 27. Nc2 Kf7 28. Ne3 Ke6 29. Rc7 { And Black is lost }) (26... Kf7 27. Rc7+ { Is also not good for
Black }) (26... h6 { Was probably the most resiient } 27. Nc2 Kf7 28. Ne3 Ke6 29. g4 { [pgndiagram] But with Nf5+ coming, it is also very difficult to defend }) 27. h4!! { [pgndiagram] I will be honest, when I first saw this game, i
completely failed to understand this move. Why does Kasparov attach two
exclamation marks to a move that simply drops a pawn? Why is this move so
good?   The reply is obvious - White simply fix the weakness and h5. } (27. Nc2 Kf7 28. Rc7+ Ke6 29. Ne3 Rd8 { [pgndiagram] Black is OK }) 27... Nd7?! (27... gxh4 28. Nd3 Kg7 29. Nf4 { [pgndiagram] And we can see the
point - both h5 and d5 are weak }) (27... Kf7 { Was nevertheless more tenacious } 28. Rc7+ Kg6 29. hxg5 fxg5 30. Nf3 Kf5 31. Rh7 h4 32. Rg7 { [pgndiagram]

prevents the further advance of the f-pawn. The number of weaknesses increases
once again } (32. Nb4 { Would win a pawn, but also allowed some counterplay } 32... f3 33. Nxd5 Nf6 34. Rxf7 Kxf7 35. Nxb6 Ke6 { [pgndiagram] And although White is
still winning, he has to display some precision now. }) 32... gxf3 33. gxf3 a5 34. a4! { Major material gains are not far away } 34... Kf8 35. Rc6 Ke7 36. Kf2 Rf5 37. b3 Kd8 38. Ke2 Nb8!? { [pgndiagram] Desperation. Black is willing to give
up a pawn for some activity. } 39. Rg6! { A cold shower - Botvinnik doesn't
allow any counterplay whatsoever } (39. Rxb6 Kc7 40. Rb5 Nc6 { Is suddenly not
that clear }) 39... Kc7 40. Ne5 Na6 41. Rg7+ Kc8 42. Nc6 Rf6 43. Ne7+ Kb8 44. Nxd5 { [pgndiagram] Finally, the d5 pawn falls and the rest is matter of
technique } 44... Rd6 45. Rg5 Nb4 46. Nxb4 axb4 47. Rxh5 Rc6 48. Rb5 Kc7 49. Rxb4 Rh6 50. Rb5 Rxh4 51. Kd3 { [pgndiagram] A fantastic strategical masterpiece by

apparently under the influence of Steinitz's impressive wins over Zukertort
and the powerful logical arguments of the first world champion, who spoke out

the game has tranpsposed to the Nimzo-Indian defence. Botvinnik choses the

point. Black voluntarily gives up his dark squared bishop in order to double
the pawns on the c-file. } 5. bxc3 b6 6. f3 { Also quite logical. White intends
to occupy the center and intends to play on the kingisde. } 6... Ba6 7. e4 d5?! { [pgndiagram] This move was severely criticized by all the commentators. By

very annoying variation to have to face for an active Black player employing
this combative opening. } 6... e5! { [pgndiagram] One can really learn a lot from
Botvinnik. This seemingly weakens the d5 square, but Black fights for the
center and refuses to allow White to increase his space control on the kingside } 7. Nd5 { Seizing the weak square immediately } (7. f4 { Is playable. After say } 7... Nge7 8.

then continue playing in the center and on the kingside } 12... Qc7 (12... Nf5 { Was

the queen on e7 in reserve } 13. Qe1 Qe7 14. Qf2 Rae8 { With very similar
position as in the game }) 13. Be3 { [pgndiagram] White has to develop this

on h2, this pawn will be a subject of tactical ideas. If he was to advance it,
it was better to do so on the previous move } 18... Qf6 { The queen joins the battle

1. c4 { I have described the rivalty between Botvinnik and Keres in a post
dedicated to Paul Keres. This game was played in 1966, when both players were
way past their peak. Still, it is a fascinating encounter. } 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bc5 5. Nxe5 { It is hard to evaluate this move. Under the
influence of this game, 4...Bc5 was considered dangerous for Black, but in the
recent years strong grandmasters like Peter Svidler managed to prove that 5
Nxe5 is sort of a "drawing combination" - Black should be perfectly fine. } 5... Bxf2+ (5... Nxe5 6. d4 { Is better for White }) 6. Kxf2 Nxe5 7. e4 { [pgndiagram]
Almost exclusively the choice of top grandmasters } (7. d4!? { Might be more
venomous, at least on the lower level. The problem is that Black has a decent
equalizer after } 7... Nxc4 8. e4 d5! { And I don'  think White can fight for
advantage here } 9. exd5 Nb6 10. Qe2+ Kf8 11. Bg2 Nfxd5 { And Black is very
comfortable }) 7... c5! { And important move - Black can't really allow d4 } 8. d3 { [pgndiagram] By old standards, White is practically winning - two bishops,
weak d5 square, etc. However, the modern theory proves Black is perfectly fine
here. } 8... d6 9. h3 h5?! { Perhaps this move is not strictly required - White
wasn't threatening to expand in any case } (9... O-O 10. Kg1 h6 11. Bf4 Bd7 { Was more normal, just developing smoothly. Fast castling was also how Svidler
treated this positions, say in the game Aronian - Svidler, World Championship
Tournament 2007 }) 10. Be2 Nh7 11. Kg2 h4 12. g4 Ng5 { [pgndiagram] Black
seemingly has a nice blockade on the dark squares, but actually he isn't
threatening anything, and the loss of time allowed White to develop and
initiate play of his own } 13. Be3 (13. d4 { Was actually quite strong already } 13... cxd4 14. Qxd4 Ne6 15. Qd5 { With pressure against d6 }) 13... Bd7?! { Again
ignoring d4 } (13... b6 { Reducing the effects of d4, was preferable } 14. d4 cxd4 15. Qxd4 Ne6 16. Qd5 Ba6 17. Rad1 O-O { And now White can't take on d6 } 18. b3 Qf6 { [pgndiagram] And Black has some counterplay }) 14. Qd2 { [pgndiagram] But
White also refrains from playing it } (14. d4 { Came into consideration,
although Black has } 14... Ng6 { And White can't really take the pawn } 15. dxc5 dxc5 16. Qd6 { Is, however, unpleasant } (16. Bxc5 Nf4+)) 14... Ne6 { Removing the
knight from attack and looking at the d4 and f4 squares } 15. b4 (15. Rhf1 { White could have completed his development, but than he should have reckoned
with } 15... Nd4 16. Bxd4 cxd4 17. Nd5 O-O { Leads to the same variation examined
after 15...Nd4 }) 15... b6?! (15... Nd4 { Was once again possible. } 16. Nd5 (16. Bxd4 cxd4 17. Nd5 O-O 18. Rhf1 { Is ok for Black, White has slightly more space,
but it is hard to suggest a plan })) 16. Rab1 { [pgndiagram] Preparing for the
future opening of the b-file } (16. Nd5 O-O 17. Rhf1 Bc6 18. a4 { It also made
sense to keep the rook on the a-file and try for the a4-a5 push. } 18... Nd4 { And
White retains some advantage } (18... a5 { To my human mind, this move would be
logical. However, after } 19. b5 Bb7 20. Rf2 { [pgndiagram] The queenside is
blocked, and White can start operating on the kingside. Black has less space,
so it is harder for him to move his pieces to the aid of his king })) 16... Bc6 17. Rhf1 Bb7?! 18. Kg1 Nc6?! { Once again delaying castling. The move seems
sensible, exploiting the d4 square. But as it will turn out, The knight on e5
was a good piece and the knight on d4 will be doing nothing } (18... O-O 19. Nd5 Rc8 { And now a4-a5 plan, employed in the game, is less effective. Say } 20. a4 Nd4 21. Bd1 Bxd5 22. cxd5 Qc7 { [pgndiagram] And White is sightly better, but
Black is very much in the game }) 19. Nd5 Ncd4 20. Bd1 { [pgndiagram] Now Black
has some issues. The problem is he can't take on d5, as his knight on e6 will
get hit, and it doesn't have a good square. Compare this to a previous
variation where the knight from e6 jumped to d4. } 20... f6? { But this is a fatal
weakening. In the future, g5 will be deadly. } (20... O-O { For better or for
worse, Black should have castled } 21. bxc5 dxc5 22. g5 { And White is clearly
better, but the game is far from over }) 21. Kh2? { This time, Botvinnik plays
too cautiously } (21. g5 { Was deadly here. After } 21... Nxg5 22. Bxg5 fxg5 23. bxc5 dxc5 24. Ba4+ { [pgndiagram] Even more precise than the immediate Qh2 } (24. Qh2 Bxd5 25. exd5 Rf8 26. Bh5+ { Is also winning though }) 24... Bc6 25. Qh2 { And
Black is just busted }) 21... Bc6 (21... O-O 22. g5 { Now doesn't work - Black
has castled and can simply take } 22... fxg5 23. Bg4 Bxd5 24. exd5 Nf4 { [pgndiagram]
And nothing terrible for Black is apparent }) 22. a4 { Botvinnik pursues his
plan consistently } (22. g5 { Was once again possible, although without Qh2, it
is not as deadly } 22... Nxg5 23. Bxg5 fxg5 24. Bg4 { And due to his king being
uncastled, Black has issues }) 22... a5?! { But this only helps White - the
b-file is added to his arsenal } (22... O-O { Was the alternative } 23. Qf2 g5 { And the position is ugly, but defensible }) 23. bxa5 bxa5 24. Qf2 (24. g5!) 24... Ra7? { A mistake, but the position was very difficult } (24... O-O { Is
suggested by the engine as the best move, but it is understandable that Black
didn't want to lose a pawn when he had just avoided castling for a number of
moves }) 25. g5! { [pgndiagram] Finally, Botvinnik carries out this strong
advance } 25... O-O!? { The best defensive try } (25... Nxg5 26. Bxg5 fxg5 27. Bh5+ Rxh5 28. Qf8+ { [pgndiagram] Is winning for White }) 26. g6 { White is
threatening Qxh4 and Black has to do something } 26... f5? { A final mistake - a
tactical oversight } (26... Be8 { Focusing on the g-pawn was the only defence.
White's best continuation is to defend it with his queen } 27. Qg2! { [pgndiagram] Very important but not the easiest move to find. And then he
threatens Qg4-Qh5-Qh7. Then after } (27. Rg1 f5 { And Black has avoided the worst }) 27... f5 28. exf5 Rxf5 29. Rxf5 Nxf5 30. Qg4 Nfd4 31. Bxd4 Nxd4 32. Qh5 { Black will be forced to sacrifice a piece, but at least he could have hoped
White won't find the accurate 27th move }) 27. Rb8 { [pgndiagram] A brilliant
concluding stroke on the theme of diversion. Once the queen takes the rook (or
moves anywhere, for that matter), White takes on h4 and checkmates. In my
opinion a brilliant game, displaying Botvinnik's best characteristics -
consistent implementation of a strategical plan followed up by a decisive
tactical combo. } 1-0

in hope of creating some counterplay } 20. Rxf5! (20. Qxf5 Qxf5 21. Rxf5 Ng6 { Is suddenly unpleasant for White }) 20... cxd4 21. exd4 Nd7 { [pgndiagram] And
although White is clearly better, it is definitely not easy - Black's pieces
spring to life }) 20. e4! { Once again we see this iron consistency from
Botvinnik and a perfect implementation of the plan } 20... Qd6 (20... fxe4 { Would be
horrible - another knight joins the game, for instance } 21. Nxe4 Qd5 22. Kh1 Ba6 (22... Qxd4 23. Nxc6) 23. Rf4 c5 24. Rg4 Kh8 25. Qf2 { [pgndiagram] With
devastating attack }) 21. Rd1 Ne6? { Another mistake - the pin on the knight
will be very uncomfortable and the communication with the f5 pawn is broken } (21... Ng6 { For better or for worse, this should have been played } 22. exf5 Nxe5 23. Ne4! Nf3+ (23... Qc7 24. dxe5 Qxe5 25. Nd6) 24. Rxf3 Qd5 25. Nc3 { With
definite advantage for White, but it is not yet over }) 22. Qb3! { This is
very unpleasant for Black } 22... fxe4 23. Rf7! { [pgndiagram] The best move of the
game in my opinion, preparing a deadly threat } 23... a5? { Which Black completely
misses } (23... e3 24. Ne4 Qd5 { Would have prevented combination, because after } 25. Qxe3 (25. Rxg7+ Kxg7 { The queen can't go to g3 }) 25... Rf8 { Black is at
least not immediately lost }) 24. Nxe4! { [pgndiagram] And here Robatsch
resigned, because after } 24... Qd8 (24... Qd5 { Is no better } 25. Rxg7+ Kxg7 26. Qg3+ Kf8 27. Rf1+ Ke7 28. Qh4+ { Black gets checkmated }) 25. Rxg7+ Kxg7 26. Qg3+ Ng5 27. Nxg5 { [pgndiagram] He is bound to get checkmated. Another below-30 move
crush by Botvinnik in a seemingly strategical position. There is so much to
learn from his games! } 1-0

1. c4 e6 2. Nc3 d5 3. d4 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 c6 6. e3 Be7 7. Qc2 O-O 8. Bd3 Nbd7 { Once again, the same variation as in the previous game against Robatsch. } 9. Nge2 { This time Botvinnik chooses the second most popular move. White's
idea in this variation is to prepare the quick f3-e4 advance in the center.
Black will try to counter it with c5 and a subsequent queenside expansion. } 9... h6 { A good move, forcing the Bishop's hand } 10. Bh4 (10. Bf4 Nh5) 10... Re8 11. f3 { [pgndiagram] Preparing the advance in the center } 11... c5 { Countering it
immediately. Now it is not so easy for White to advance in the center - he
needs to secure stability of the d4 point first } 12. O-O a6 13. Rad1 b5 14. Bf2 { This is strictly speaking all theory, but somehow the engine doesn't approve
of this decision } (14. dxc5 { The computer suggests White should react to the
queenside expansion and alter the pawn structure. After } 14... Bxc5 15. Nd4 Qb6 (15... Rxe3 { Is countered by the incredible } 16. Nxd5 Bxd4 (16... g5 17. Nxe3 Bxd4 18. Bf2) 17. Bh7+ Nxh7 18. Rxd4 { [pgndiagram] And Black has grave
difficulties }) 16. Bf2 { With double-edged play }) 14... c4 { Now Black gains
some tempi on the queenside and develops the initative } 15. Bf5 Nb6 (15... b4 { Was possible immediately. After } 16. Na4 Nb6 17. Bxc8 Rxc8 18. Nxb6 Qxb6 19. e4 dxe4 20. fxe4 { [pgndiagram] Black's queenside pawn majority is no less
dangerous than White's central pawns }) 16. Ng3 (16. a3!?) 16... Bf8?! (16... b4 17. Nce2) (16... Bxf5! { Might have been the best - Black prevents e4 } 17. Nxf5 b4 18. Nxe7+ Qxe7 19. Na4 Nxa4 20. Qxa4 Qb7 { [pgndiagram] And Black is
probably better }) 17. a3 Bb7 (17... Bxf5 { Now was the last chance for this move }) (17... h5 { Is also quite typical idea when the knight is on g3 }) 18. e4! g6 19. Bh3 a5 { [pgndiagram] Larsen is consistent in a way, but sometimes
countering the opponent's plan is even more important } (19... Nh7 { Exploiting
the position of the bishop and removing the knight from the tempo-gaining e5
was probably the best move here. After } 20. e5 Ng5 21. f4 Nxh3+ 22. gxh3 f5 { White can probably continue with } 23. h4 h5 (23... Qxh4 { Might be safer } 24. Nxf5 Qg4+ 25. Ng3 Bc8 26. h3 Bf5!?) 24. Nxf5 gxf5 25. Qxf5 { With dangerous
initiative. }) 20. e5! { [pgndiagram] Now Botvinnik carries out his favourite
central advance } (20. Nxb5 { Is not good here } 20... dxe4 21. fxe4 Nxe4) 20... b4 (20... Nh7 21. f4 { Is just crushing }) 21. Nce2 (21. axb4 { Would be obviously
bad - why open the a-file }) 21... Nh7 22. f4! { [pgndiagram] Very strong and
consistent } 22... Bc6 (22... bxa3 { Black can win a pawn, but after } 23. bxa3 Bxa3 24. f5 g5 25. f6 { [pgndiagram] He has too many problems on the other side of the
board for the pawn to make a difference. }) 23. Ra1! { To my mind, this and
the following move are the best moves of the game, demonstrating Botvinnik's
deep understanding of the position. White avoids the Ba4 threat and moves his
rook to a1(!) in anticipation of the opening of the a-file } 23... Ba4 24. Qb1! { Another brilliant strategical move. The queen is maintained on the b1-h7
diagonal, keeping the f5 square under control } 24... f5?! { Black wants to prevent
f5 in radical fashion, but this plays in White's hands } (24... c3 25. bxc3 b3 26. f5 g5 27. f6 Nc4 { Was more prudent, with a double-edged position }) 25. axb4 axb4 26. Nxf5! { [pgndiagram] A familiar pattern - after outplaying his
opponent, Botvinnik resorts to tactical measures to crown his strategy. } 26... gxf5 27. Bxf5 Qe7 28. Ng3 { [pgndiagram] Bringing up the reserves, but there were
better continuations available } (28. Bg6 Red8 (28... Bb5 { Is sightly more
resillient, but after } 29. Bxe8 Qxe8 30. Rxa8 Nxa8 31. f5 { White is cose to
winning all the same }) 29. f5 { Was simply devastating }) 28... Bd7 (28... Bb5 { Was apparently stronger. After } 29. Qc2 Kh8 30. Bg6 b3 31. Qe2 Na4 { The game
virtually starts anew }) 29. Bxd7 Nxd7 (29... Qxd7 30. Qg6+ { Drops the knight
on b6 }) 30. Qg6+ { [pgndiagram] Now White has strong compensation for the piece } 30... Qg7 31. Qc6 Rxa1 32. Rxa1 Qf7 33. Ra7 Nxe5? { In a difficult position, Larsen
cracks under the tension and commits a final blunder } (33... Nb8 { Was the only
way of continuing. Then after } 34. Qa4 Qe6 35. f5 Qc6 36. Qd1 { White has the
advanatage, but there is still a lot of play in the position }) 34. dxe5 Qe6 (34... Qxa7 { [pgndiagram] Larsen missed the rook is defended? } 35. Bxa7) 35. Qxe6+ Rxe6 36. Nf5 { [pgndiagram] The rest is the matter of technique } 36... Rc6 37. Kf1 c3 38. bxc3 bxc3 39. Be3 Bc5 40. Bxc5 Rxc5 41. Ra1 Nf8 42. Ke2 Ne6 43. g3 h5 44. Kd3 d4 45. Nd6 Rc7 46. Ne4 Kh7 47. f5 Nd8 48. Nf6+ Kh6 49. Nd5 Rb7 50. e6 Nc6 51. Ra6 Ne5+ 52. Kxd4 { [pgndiagram] A brilliant game. Even top
grandmaster like Larsen could not compete against Botvinnik in clear,
strategical positions. Botvinnik's deep strategical idea of Ra1 and Qb1
deserves a lot of praise! } 1-0
